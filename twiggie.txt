I am changing your repository by adding a text file. I also branched it and am I am working on my own branch now.

I used the following commands:

cd /Users/megaptera/Desktop
mkdir Kevin_code
cd Kevin_code
ls
git clone https://github.com/kjcai22/dnds
cd dnds
git branch
git branch twig_Laetitia
git checkout twig_Laetitia
git branch # now the star is at my new twig
